# pactl-volume-control
This package provides advantaged volume control for PulseAudio sinks by wrapping around the command line tool `pactl`.
It provides basic features like limiting the range of volume levels and outputting the current volume levels on their own. 
This is useful for controlling audio devices from the command line that don't provide controls in alsa-mixer. 

##### Note: This tool is currently in an early development phase; expect breaking changes to occur.

## Installation

Installation details will be provided when the package is in a workable state.
